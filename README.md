# Mastermind-solver
This code finds a solution to any game of Mastermind

Being fascinated by this game after playing this game as a child with my dad, I decided to write a program that solves any configuration.
You enter a 4-digit number (canonly contain digits [1;8]) which represents the different colors used in the game.
The program then solves the given configuration step-by-step (each step is outputted).

The layout of the output is:
abcd: e,f

Where a,b,c and d are digits [1;8]. Each one represents a color.
Where e and f are digits [0;4]. Each one represents a pin (e black, f white)

I based this algorithm on a video from the Youtube-channel "Numberphile".

Don't cheat! ;)
